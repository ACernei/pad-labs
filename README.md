### Usage

Download [compose.yaml](./Lab1/compose.yaml) file.

Open in terminal the folder where the `compose.yaml` file is located.

Run the following command:
 >docker compose up

### Postman collection 

For testing the endpoints import the [postman collection](./PAD.postman_collection.json) into your prefered API collaboration tool.

The order of endpoints doesn't matter. However make sure that the database is populated before you make a `DELETE` or a `GET` request.
